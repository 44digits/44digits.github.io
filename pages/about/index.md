I'm Andrew, a spatial data engineer based in Southern California. Welcome to my
personal blog, where I share intriguing projects I've been immersed in.

With degrees in Computer Science, Psychology, and International Development,
I've tackled development projects in challenging environments including Afghanistan,
Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  
Over the past decade, I've focused on building solutions closer to home,
harnessing geospatial technologies. I've honed my skills in Python,
orchestrating spatial data workflows, and implementing cloud solutions in both
Azure and AWS.
Thanks for reading!
